A beautifully designed, cheat sheet for **mathematical symbols** across pure math, algebra, geometry, trigonometry,calculus, physics, chemistry, and more. Built for students, teachers, and curious minds who need quick access to symbols, meanings, LaTeX code, and MathWorld links.


## What's Inside? 📚
- **Core Math**: Set Theory, Logic, Algebra, Arithmetic, Relations, Number Sets
- **Advanced**: Calculus, Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Geometry, Trigonometry
- **Sciences**: Physics Essentials, Chemistry
- **Greek Alphabet**: Full uppercase/lowercase with variants
- **Features**:
  - Instant search across all symbols
  - Copy LaTeX code with one click
  - Dark mode toggle
  - Export to PDF
  - Responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop

Every symbol includes: **Unicode**, **name**, **meaning**, **LaTeX/KaTeX code**, and a direct link to [Wolfram MathWorld](https://mathworld.wolfram.com).

## Quick Start 🚀
1. **View Live**:  https://product66.id/portfolio/cybersecurity/mathsymbols.html 
to explore the full reference.
2. **Download**: Export as PDF right from the page.
3. **Use LaTeX**: Copy any code and paste into Overleaf, Jupyter, or your doc.
4. **Contribute**: Fork this repo, add symbols, or fix a link — pull requests welcome!

### Search Example
Type "integral" → instantly filter to ∫, ∬, ∭ with LaTeX like `\int` ready to copy.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks — lightweight and fast)
- **Math Rendering**: KaTeX for LaTeX previews
- **PDF Export**: html2pdf.js
- **Fonts**: Orbitron, Michroma, Asimovian (via Google Fonts)
- **Icons/Symbols**: Unicode + MathWorld links

## Installation (Local Dev)
1. Clone the repo: `git clone [(https://github.com/JPixelByte/math-symbols-reference)]`
2. Open `index.html` in any browser.
3. Tweak CSS/JS as needed — fully self-contained.
